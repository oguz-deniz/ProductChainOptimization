# ProductChainOptimization

### Problem Description:
The Dairy Product Chain Optimization project addresses the production and delivery of a new type of fruit yogurt, specifically designed for the Summer 2023 season. Production takes place weekly, with deliveries scheduled for 7 a.m. every Thursday. The company operates 25 machines with varying capacities, but only a maximum of 7 machines (excluding Machine 4) can be used simultaneously due to energy-efficient productivity goals. The project aims to maximize profit by deciding which additional orders, in addition to regular orders, can be accepted. Regular orders must be fulfilled, and additional orders yield additional profit.
